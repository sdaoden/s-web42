Overview
========

S-Web42 is one more option to manage your website.  It offers the
possibility to expand a directory hierarchy of input files, some of
which may consist of a mixture of PIs, (uninterpreted) (X)HTML or XML
markup and normal text.  In those which do, PIs can be defined and
undefined, they may be defined to take arguments (think format strings),
which can be, e.g., a handy way to create complex tables; `perl(1)`_
code can be evaluated, files can be included, also recursively; simple
control statements can be used to conditionalize file content, and
some simple MarkLo tags aid in make editing life a bit easier, too.

The ``s-web42`` converter is a `perl(1)`_ script, i.e., it needs an
installed Perl, version 5.8.1 or above.  It also requires the authors
`S-SymObj`_ module -- you may install it as a regular part of your
`perl(1)`_ installation by issuing the command ``$ cpan S-SymObj``.
Alternatively you may also get it from http://www.CPAN.org, clone the
git repository from ``git://git.code.sf.net/p/ssymobj/code`` or browse
it on http://sourceforge.net/p/ssymobj/code.

``s-web42`` also uses the standard POSIX tools ``sed(1)``, ``sh(1)``,
``uudecode(1)``, ``uuencode(1)`` and, optionally, data compressors
(one of ``compress(1)``, ``gzip(1)``, ``bzip2(1)`` and ``xz(1)`` may
be used).

Synopsis
========

::

   s-web42 [-v[v]]
   s-web42 [-v[v]] [--no-rc] --no-update-cache (or: --nuc)
   s-web42 [-v[v]] [--no-rc] --force-rebuild [--nuc]
   s-web42 [-v[v]] [--no-rc] --expand-one [FILE] (or: --eo [FILE])

   perl -C -I/PATH/TO/SymObj.pm s-web42

   PERL5OPT=-C PERL5LIB=/PATH/TO/SymObj.pm
   export PERL5OPT PERL5LIB
   s-web42

Use ``--no-rc`` to suppress reading of an existent ``config.rc`` file.
The ``--no-update-cache`` option can be used to suppress an update of
the cache database -- i.e., rerunning ``s-web42`` again will generate
the very same output.  With the ``--force-rebuild`` option an existing
cache database can be ignored so that effectively everything is rebuild
from scratch; this mode may be combined with ``--no-update-cache``.

The ``--expand-one`` option will read the programs standard input or
``FILE``, if one was specified, expand and filter it just as described
below, and write the resulting content to the programs standard output.
This is an isolated and special mode in that none of the described
website management actions are performed, except of reading in the
optional configuration file, as described below.

The ``-v`` option can be used to gain some verbosity, using it twice
will be even more verbose; if used in conjunction with ``--expand-one``
these messages will go to the standard error instead.  The trailing
two examples show how to extend the `perl(1)`_ ``@INC`` path so that
the required `S-SymObj`_ module will be found without installing that
in a regular place, a task that often requires administrator privileges.
And please be aware that no effort is put in parsing command line
arguments: one needs to use the very format shown above.

.. note::
   S-Web42 is charset agnostic.  It reads and writes files, and simply
   reuses the actual character encoding that `perl(1)`_ has chosen to
   use.  It is therefore highly desirable to either use the ``-C``
   command line option of `perl(1)`_ or to set the ``PERL5OPT``
   environment variable to this value, because **only like that**
   `perl(1)`_ tries to reflect the users locale settings in respect
   to Unicode-awareness of its input and output!  Please see the
   ``perlrun(1)`` manual for more documentation, and the above examples
   on how to do that in a POSIX-compatible, Bourne or Korn shell.

   If S-Web42 detects that `perl(1)`_ does not use UTF-8 I/O even
   though the users locale is UTF-8 aware it'll complain remarkably.

WhatIs?
=======

S-Web42 consists of only one file: ``s-web42``.  Well, there are
``header``, ``footer``, ``template.html``, ``hook`` and ``config.rc``,
but these form a (somewhat primitive and rather identical to the
authors very own website) usage example only, they are not required
for operation.

Once invoked, the converter script ``s-web42`` requires the subdirectory
``site`` to exist in the current working directory, since that is used
as the input tree.  It'll also assume it can use the filenames
``cache.dat`` (the cache database), ``cache.old`` (database state
before last run), and, temporarily, ``work.tmp`` and ``w42-update.tmp``
in there.  The generated shell archive will always be ``w42-update.sh``,
and it will not have any executable bits set.

If the file ``config.rc`` is found in the working directory, and the
``--no-rc`` command line option has not been used, it'll be read --
the `Assignments`_ of PI variables seen there will form the outermost
context and will thus be inherited by all files under ``site`` (PIs
can be overridden and undefined for anything *deeper* in the hierarchy
only).  Here, and *only* here is it possible to specify some very
`Special PI variables`_.

The presence of a file ``hook`` is also recorded, and it'll be used
as a per-directory fallback hook in all those ``site`` subdirectories
which don't provide their own.  The optional per-directory hooks can
be used to create and/or modify the contents of the directory (and
subdirectories and only) on the fly.  It is a fatal error if such a
hook is not an executable program or if it doesn't exit successfully.
Hooks will be given one command line argument, and that is the current
working directory from within which the hook is run.

Then the converter will enter the ``site`` directory and recursively
parse the tree therein.  An existent per-directory hook is run at that
point, and before deeper levels of the hierarchy are entered.  Note
that the directory entries ``SCCS``, ``CVS`` and anything which starts
with a dot (thus also ``.git`` and ``.RCS``) are completely ignored
by S-Web42.  It is not possible to savely create directories on the
fly except in deeper, not yet parsed hierarchy levels below the current
directory, too.

.. note::
   S-Web42 won't handle paths with embedded quotation marks, i.e.,
   neither ``"`` nor ``'`` characters may be used for directory- and
   filenames.  You should possibly be conservative about filenames in
   general, mostly in respect to embedded whitespace, as the implemented
   quoting rules are primitive, yet sufficient.

After the entire tree has been traversed like that once, the content
of all directories will be reread, and the resulting tree will be
compared against the version recorded in the cache database.  Anything
which is missing or which seems to be modified will be rebuild, either
as a bitwise copy of the source or as the result of S-Web42 filtering,
as below.  Filtering will be applied to all files which' name includes
the string ``-w42``, or, to be exact, which name' end with a string
that matches |fextre|.

S-Web42 assumes that a file is modified if its modification timestamp
is different from that recorded in the cache database (but see
`IGNORE_MODTIME`_) and if its |checksum| is different from the recorded
one.  One can force rebuilding of S-Web42-filtered files on a per-file
base by using a filename that includes the suffix ``-new``, as in
``index.html-w42-new`` -- neither modification time nor input checksums
will matter for such files, they will *always* be rebuild.

.. note::
   Files included via the ``<?include?>`` PI are *not* checked, i.e.,
   no dependency tracking is performed.

Any file rebuild non-bitwise is then checksummed again, and will *only*
be part of the result if the |checksum| of the rebuilt target is
different from the checksum stored in the cache database, but not
otherwise.  (The only exception to this rule is if the user uses the
``--force-rebuild`` command line option, as that'll rebuild anything
from scratch.)

So, what will the result look like?  One may be astonished, but the
result will be generated as a shell archive with ``uuencode(1)``\ d
(and, optionally, `COMPRESS`_\ ed) members.  These archives can either
be used to update a local mirror (``$ sh w42-update.sh --local
TARGET-PATH``) or as a ``sftp(1)`` batchfile (``$ sh w42-update.sh
--sftp TMP-PATH | sftp -b - user@host[:dir]; rm -rf TMP-PATH``).  In
the latter case ``TMP-PATH`` must be some temporary path that can be
used by the archive to unpack its contents therein (it'll issue a
``mkdir TMP-PATH``, i.e., create that directory as necessary).

During operation, the generated shell archive will try to ignore any
errors, continuing it's operation until all commands have been issued.
E.g., in ``sftp(1)`` batch mode, the termination-on-error is suppressed
by prefixing commands with a hyphen ``-``.  Any error, and some other
informational messages will be logged to standard error, however.

File and directory removals will also be properly handled.  However,
if the cache database (a textfile) is lost, then the only solution is
to delete the target directory manually and to rebuild it with a new
from-scratch archive.

On filenames and -content
=========================

S-Web42 doesn't look into files unless their name ends with a special
suffix.  If that isn't seen, files will be treated as bins of undefined
binary content and handled bitwise.  If, on the other hand, the filename
ends with the suffix |fextre|, then it'll be subject to content
filtering, as described in the rest of this document.  Let's inspect
that cryptic expression:

``(.*?)``
   S-Web42 doesn't care, simply name any file the way you want, with
   or without a file extension.  It doesn't matter.

``(-w42 ... )$`` -- S-Web42 filter trigger
   If, after the ignored part, the string ``-w42`` is seen, as in
   ``index.html-w42``, then this file is flagged as being subject of
   S-Web42 content filtering.

   .. note::
      The trailing S-Web42 specific part will be stripped from the
      filename so that, e.g., an input file ``index.html-w42-new``
      will produce an output file ``index.html``.

``(?:-(x|[icewpatsm]+))?`` -- Mode configuration
   It is possible to fine tune the behaviour of S-Web42 content filtering
   and expansion by continuing the ``-w42`` suffix with a hyphen ``-``
   and then either the letter ``x`` or any combination of the letters
   ``icewpatsm``.  This is described in detail in the section
   `About.Filter`_.  An example of such a filename would be
   ``index.html-w42-cea``.

(-new)? -- Forced rebuild trigger
   If the suffix ends with a trailing ``-new`` part, then both, the
   modification time and the files input checksum will not be used to
   decide wether a file has been modified or not.  Instead it'll always
   be rebuild, and the decision wether to include the file in the
   result or not is based upon the checksum of the generated file.  A
   filename example would be ``index.php-w42-x-new``.

Moreover, all files that are subject to S-Web42 content filtering (and
``config.rc`` but this is a special case in that S-Web42 will complain
if it contains anything else but the `Assignments`_ part) have to
comply to a very specific content layout scheme:

   | `Assignments`_
   | ``<?begin?>``
   | `Content`_
   | ``<?end?>``
   | `Ignored`_

About.Filter
------------

These filter operations will be performed on the `Assignments`_ part
of *all* files which are subject to filtering.  They'll also be applied
to the `Content`_ part unless the mode configuration suffix was ``-x``
or otherwise excluded these actions:

*Drop of trailing whitespace* (cannot be disabled)
   A lines' trailing whitespace is discarded.

*Drop of introductional whitespace* (disable mode: ``i``)
   A lines' leading whitespace is discarded.  This step will always be
   performed on follow lines after escaped newlines, as below.

*Handling of shell style comments* (disable mode: ``c``)
   If the first non-whitespace character of a line is a number sign
   ``#``, then this line is a comment and as such discarded.

*Escaping of newlines* (disable mode: ``e``)
   If the last character of a non-comment line is a backslash that is
   not itself escaped by a(n uneven number of) backslash(es), then the
   next line is joined with the current line after its leading whitespace
   has been discarded.

*Wiping away empty lines* (disable mode: ``w``)
   If a line is empty then remember it was there but ignore it otherwise.

These filter operations will be performed on the `Content`_ part unless
the mode configuration excluded them:

*PI expansion* (disable mode: ``p``)
   Processing Instructions will be expanded.

These filter operations will be performed on the `Content`_ part unless
the mode configuration suffix was ``-x`` or otherwise excluded these
actions:

*Automatic paragraphs* (disable mode: ``a``)
   If a textblock is surrounded by empty lines it'll be enclosed in
   a ``<p></p>`` pair (unless the block seems to be enclosed in
   a tag).

*Tagsoup joining* (disable mode: ``t``)
   The DOM standard (http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core) is used to
   transform site content to DOM objects.  Unfortunately code like ::

      </p>
      <p>

   (may) result(s) in a useless DOM object covering the newline in
   between the two tags.  To circumvent that S-Web42 tries to join
   tags like these together.

*Whitespace normalization* (disable mode: ``s``)
   Once the line content is fully expanded (leading and) trailing
   whitespace is removed (again) and multiple adjacent whitespace
   characters are squeezed to a single (ASCII) space character.

*MarkLo expansion* (disable mode: ``m``)
   As a last step some *MarkLo* markers will be converted to markup:

   * ``*CONTENT*`` will be ``<it>CONTENT</it>``.
   * ``**CONTENT**`` will be ``<b>CONTENT</b>``.
   * ``_CONTENT_`` will be ``<ul>CONTENT</ul>``.
   * \` ``CONTENT``\ ` will be ``<tt>CONTENT</tt>``.

   To prevent these expansions, escape the (first) trigger character
   with a backslash -- such a backslash will be removed: to have
   a backslash in front of one of the trigger characters, escape the
   backslash with a(n) (uneven number of) backslash(es).

Finally a ``-w42`` file content example::

   WHO = Ziggy
   <?begin?>

   Yo S-Web42.

   <?WHO?>.
   # This is a comment line.
      # Yet another comment line
    This LN \
      use\
         s *NL* escaping.\\\\

   <?end?>
   ->
   <p>Yo S-Web42.</p><p>Ziggy. This LN uses <it>NL</it> escaping.\\</p>

But -- feel free::

   <?begin?>*Hello*, S-Web42.<?end?>
   ->
   <it>Hello</it>, S-Web42.

Assignments
-----------

The content is prefixed by the (PI) variable assignment block. ::

   var1 = content of var1
   var2 ?= conditional assignment (if not yet defined)
   var3 += content (assigned or) added to var3
   var4 @= var4 will be an array, this is the first value
   var4 @= the var4 array gains another value
   var5 ?@= conditional array assignment (if not yet defined)
   var5 @= append a member to the now anyway existent var5 array
   var6 = <em>markup</em><?def foo<>stupid example?><?foo?><?undef foo?>

All PI variables defined like that may contain any content, including
complete PIs and markup.  There is no technical difference in between
these and stuff defined via `def`_ and `defa`_ (and `defx`_) with the
exceptional possibility to include the PI start and close tags ``<?``
and ``?>``, respectively (as shown in the ``var6`` example).  S-Web42
PI and variable names may consist of alphabetical characters, digit
characters and the hyphen (``-``).  Note that the case matters, just
as usual for XML processing.

``=``
   Assignment to variable.
``+=``
   Assign to non-existent variable, else append value to it.
``?=``
   Assign to variable, but only if that not yet exists.
``@=``
   Array assignment -- create array as necessary and push a value onto
   it.
``?@=``
   Push value onto array, but only if that is to be newly created.

Content
-------

Everything in between the ``<?begin?>`` and ``<?end?>`` PIs is expanded
and will thus produce real output.  Line content is recursively expanded
until no further expansion is possible.

.. note::
   One should be aware that recursion applies whenever it occurs.
   E.g., if an ``<?include?>`` file includes itself a file, then this
   is performed recursively, without closing the first file descriptor
   first.  Running S-Web42 may thus encounter resource limits.

Ignored
-------

Any content after the ``<?end?>`` PI is not parsed at all.

Special PI variables
====================

There are a few PI variables which are treated in a special way, either
because they can only be set in ``config.rc``, or because they are
used by `Processing Instructions (PIs)`_ as content-injection hooks.

_`COMPRESS`
   **Only recognized in config.rc**.
   If used, it can be set to any of ``compress``, ``gzip``, ``bzip2``
   or ``xz``; it thus specifies a un-/compression method to be used
   before ``uuencode(1)``\ ing shell archive members.

_`IGNORE_MODTIME`
   **Only recognized in config.rc**.
   Causes file modification times to be ignored if set.  Maybe necessary
   if ``git`` is used as a source code control system.

_`MODTIME_AUTC`, _`MODTIME_ALOCAL`, _`MODTIME_SUTC`, _`MODTIME_SLOCAL`
   Here ``_A`` stands for "array" and ``_S`` for "string".  These are
   readonly PIs that correspond to the modification time of the currently
   processed file, in UTC and LOCAL time, respectively.  The order of
   the arrays is: 0=year, 1=month, 2=day, 3=hour, 4=minute, 5=second.
   The entry at index 6 is the string "UTC" for the UTC versions and
   the offset from UTC in the ISO 8601:2000 standard format (+hhmm or
   -hhmm) otherwise.  The strings use the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
   and, again, the UTC version appends the string " UTC" whereas the
   local version appends the string " +-ZONEOFFSET".

   .. note::
      If the ``Time::Piece`` `perl(1)`_ module cannot be loaded (it is
      believed to be a standard module since Perl version 5.10), then
      S-Web42 will only provide UTC values, even for the local
      versions.  I.e., the local ones are only aliases, then.

_`WWW`
   Will be injected in expansions of `href`_ and `hreft`_.
   Defaults to the empty string.

Processing Instructions (PIs)
=============================

It follows the list of predefined processing instructions.  PIs marked
"paired" in the list below are special in that they need a closing
``end`` tag -- to end the paired PI ``<?perl?>`` the PI ``<?perl end?>``
is necessary.

For `def`_, `defa`_ (also via implicit array vivification) and `defx`_
the same name restrictions apply to the introduced PI variable name
as has been documented for `Assignments`_.  Note that the content that
is assigned to PI variables created by those PIs may not contain PIs
themselves, of course.  It is however possible to use the pseudo-tags
``<^`` and ``^>`` as aliases, which will be automatically converted
to ``<?`` and ``?>``, respectively, and via a simple regular expression,
once the PI variable is expanded.  See `def`_ for an example.

_`def`
   Define a PI which expands to it's value part when used. ::

      <?def var1<>varcontent, may contain <em>tagsoup</em>?>
      <?def var2<>any <> content but PI start and end tags?>
      <?def var3<><^def var4<>es^><^var4^><^undef var4^>?>
      ...
      <?var1?>
      <?var2?>
      T<?var3?><?pi-if var4?>T
      ->
      varcontent, may contain <em>tagsoup</em>
      any <> content but PI start and end tags
      TesT

_`defa`
   Define or extend a PI that serves as an array.  Separate members
   are indicated by placing the empty tag ``<>`` in the value content
   (which is different to ``def``, which would simply write the empty
   tag).  Individual array members may be accessed by "calling" the
   array with the desired member index as an argument::

      <?defa arrnam<>m 1?>
      <?defa arrnam<>m 2?>
      <?defa arrnam<>m 3<>m 4?>
      ...
      <p><?arrnam 0?><?arrnam 1?>\
         <?arrnam 2?><?arrnam 3?></p>
      ->
      <p>m 1m 2m 3m 4</p>

   One may loop over an entire array by giving *loop* as the first
   argument.  In this mode two additional, optional arguments may be
   given; the first will be injected before the value, the second
   after the value.  E.g.::

      <p><?arrnam loop<><b><></b>?></p>
      ->
      <p><b>m 1</b><b>m 2</b><b>m 3</b><b>m 4</b></p>

   If the first argument is instead one of *unshift* and *push*, then
   the remaining arguments are joined to a single one and inserted at
   the front/the back of the array, respectively, auto-vivificating the
   array as necessary.  Likewise, an argument of one of *shift* and
   *pop* removes the first/the last member of the array.  In verbose
   mode a log message is emitted if the array does not have any members.
   And an argument *undef-empty* will `undef`_ the array if it is
   empty.  E.g.::

      <?test push<>entry 1?>
      <?test unshift<>entry 0?>
      <?test push<>entry 2?>
      <?test loop<><> ?><br />
      <?test pop?>
      <?test shift?>
      <?test loop<><> ?><br />
      <?test pop?>
      <?test loop<><> ?><br />
      <?test undef-empty?>
      ->
      entry 0 entry 1 entry 2 <br />entry 1 <br /><br />

_`defx`
   Define a PI which takes arguments (think format strings).  Arguments
   are indicated by placing the empty tag ``<>`` in the value content
   -- those tags will be replaced by the corresponding user-supplied
   argument when used (which is different to ``def``, which would
   simply write the empty tag). ::

      <?defx var2<>Expanded <> var <> content <>?>
      ...
      <?var2 arg1<>arg2<>arg3?>
      ->
      Expanded arg1 var arg2 content arg3

_`href`, _`hreft`, _`lref`, _`lreft`
   These purely convenience PIs expand to (X)HTML hyperlinks; the first
   two should be used to create links which leave the site (see `WWW`_),
   the other two for site-local ones.  The versions without the ``t``
   suffix take one argument, the others will also create a ``title``
   attribute and thus require two arguments. ::

      <?href http://www.netbsd.org?>
      -> <a href="http://www.netbsd.org">www.netbsd.org</a>
      <?hreft http://www.opensource.org<><em>Lots</em> of licenses?>
      -> <a href="http://www.opensource.org" title="Lots of licenses"
         ><em>Lots</em> of licenses</a>

_`ifdef`, _`ifndef`, _`else`, _`fi`
   Simple conditional control statements which test for (non)existence
   of a variable (PI) and process the enclosed block only if the
   condition is true.  (You may also "test" for ``0``, which evaluates
   as not defined.) ::

      <p>
      <?ifndef HOMEPAGE?>
       <?lreft index.html<>[HOME]?>
      <?else?>
       Jo-ho hooo -- welcome on my homepage, dude!
      <?fi?>
      </p>

_`include`, _`raw_include`
   The PI ``<?include?>`` can be used to include a file that itself
   will be subject to the same expansion and filtering that is in use
   for the including file, whereas the ``<?raw_include?>`` PI will
   include the given file raw and **without any** S-Web42 processing.
   Paths are interpreted relative to the source directory of the file
   which defines the include directive. ::

      HOME = ../index.html
      <?begin?>
      <?include ../../header?>

      Hello World, v2.

      <pre>
      <?raw_include /etc/passwd?>
      </pre>

      <?include ../../footer?>
      <?end?>

   .. note::
      If the path starts with a tilde ``~``, that will be replaced by
      the value of the environment variable ``HOME``.  Likewise, if
      the path starts with a plus sign ``+``, then that'll be replaced
      with the content of the environment variable ``WEB42INC``.  Note
      it is really that simple.

   .. note::
      By **definition** there is really no notion of a "chroot".  One
      may leave ``site`` absolutely or relatively, just as desired.

_`perl`, _`shell`
   These are paired statements which can be used to embed ``perl(1)``
   or ``shell(1)`` code that will be evaluated (in a forked subprocess).
   The output that is produced on STDOUT will be re-evaluated (as it
   is produced) and may thus contain more PIs.  ::

      <?perl?>
      my $gmd = gmtime;
      my $lmd = localtime;

      print '<p>Hi <?USER?>!';
      print "It is $lmd.<br />";
      print "That is $gmd UTC!</p>"
      <?perl end?>

   .. note::
      Escaped newlines and shell-style comments are not handled while
      this mode is active.  (It can be used as usual for output that
      is produced by the perl or shell code, however.)

_`pi-if`
   If it is unsure wether a PI (variable) exists, use this PI to
   "invoke" it, instead of the PI itself.  I.e., pass arguments etc.
   just as you would do if you would use the PI directly, but give the
   name of the PI as the first argument.  ``pi-if`` will not cause
   errors but only produce some log messages if the used PI does not
   exist.

_`pre`, _`xpre`
   The "preformatted" paired PIs.  By default the converter trims and
   squeezes whitespace and tries to join the input tagsoup, so as to
   minimize useless DOM objects and file size.  Inside these preformatted
   PIs it won't do so.  Since that is mostly of interest inside of
   HTML ``<pre>`` tags, the expansion of the ``<?xpre?>`` PI contains
   this tag already.

   .. note::
      Escaped newlines and shell-style comments are not handled while
      evaluating input from these modes.

_`undef`
   Undefine an user defined array or PI.

   .. note::
      This undefines in the current context **only**!  I.e., if ``file1``
      defines the PI ``DOIT`` and then includes ``file2``, then an
      ``<?undef DOIT?>`` from within ``file2`` will **not** affect
      ``file1``, but only ``file2`` and deeper contexts.

Future Directions
=================

The convertion phase can be parallelized without much effort.
Add a special ``MAXJOBS`` or similar special ``config.rc`` PI variable
to control this, then.
